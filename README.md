# Updated-portfolio

Overview:

This document is a portfolio summarizing my projects to date. The portfolio was constructed using HTML and CSS tools and has been designed as a responsive webpage which can be used across various screen sizes.

The application begins with an interactive navigation bar that provides a smooth link to the main parts of the webpage. I've included a 'Home' section welcoming visitors to the page - included in this section too is my avatar. The next portion of the application is an 'About Me' section describing briefly my journey to coding. Additionally, I have included a display picture within this section too.

The third component is a 'Projects' section with a gallery of images that represent current and future work. The first image is greater in size compared to the others and is a link to a deployed application I have previously produced. The other four images are acting as placeholders for future projects which I will gradually link deployed applications to as I continue developing my portfolio. The final part of the webpage is a 'Contact' form allowing future clients to contact me for queries about work.

Key features to look out for in this application include:

1) When you click onto a navigation link, it takes you to its corresponding section.

2) The work section has cards of recent deployed applications.

3) The webpage is responsive to different screen sizes through the use of bootstrap.

4) Accessibility is a core priority so that everyone can access the webpage.

5) Typography and colour scheme was carefully selected to create a cohesive and attractive application.
